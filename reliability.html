            It is inevitable that there will be deviations between designed
            circuits and actual circuits, either from limited manufacturing
            precision, aging of the devices, or even failure of some components.
            These deviations can cause the circuit to produce unreliable
            outputs. Thus, it is important to consider these factors during the
            circuit design process.

          <div class="mytext">
            It is notable that circuit reliability is a multifaceted issue that
            can be optimized from a variety of perspectives, including
            materials, manufacturing processes, and so on. My work focuses on
            optimization at the algorithmic level, where the reliability of a
            circuit can be improved by designing parameters that are insensitive
            to changes.

          <div class="section-spacing"></div>
          <div class="mytext">
            <b>Manufacturing error</b> is one of the most significant factors.
            Due to the limited operation precision of the manufacturing
            equipments and the e.g., the dispersion of the inks in printed
            electronics, the deviation shows a uniform distribution around the
            designed value.
          </div>
          <div class="mytext">
            <b>Aging</b> changes the component values continuously over time.
            The aging process of the PEDOT:PSS resistor follows a
            exponential-like curve.
          </div>
          <div class="mytext">
            <b>Sensing uncertainty</b>, as a part of the whole electronics, is
            also a factor that impacts the reliability of the neuromorphic
            circuits. This error is a synthetical result from fabrication error,
            coupling between sensor and object being measured, environmental
            noise, etc. It is generally modeled as a Gaussian distribution.
          </div>
          <div class="mytext">
            <b>Device fault</b>, which generally caused by catastrophe during
            fabrication or usage. Unlike manufacturing error, fault usually
            leads to more unacceptable consequences, such as short circuit, open
            circuit, etc.

            circuit. Figure 3 shows some transfer characteristics of the
            nonlinear circuits with varying conductances and transistances. (In

          <h4>Reliability-aware training of neuromorphic circuit</h4>
          <div class="section-spacing"></div>
          <div class="mytext">
            The objective of reliability-aware training is to improve the
            expected performance w.r.t. the stochastic noisy factors. For
            example, in the aging-aware training, the training objective is
            <p>
              $$ \begin{aligned} &\min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_t \left\{
              L(x,y,\theta(t))\right\} \\ =&\min_{\theta} \int_t
              L(x,y,\theta(t)){\rm d}t \end{aligned} $$
            </p>
            However, the optimization variable is not a value but a function.
            Through reparameterization we can extract \( \theta_0 \) from \(
            \theta(t) \) by
            <p>$$ \theta(t) = \theta_0 \cdot A_{\omega}(t), $$</p>
            where \( \theta_0 \) is the surrogate conductance at \(t=0\), i.e.,
            the manufactured value, \( A_{\omega}(t) \) refers to aging-decay,
            and \( \omega \) is stochastic variable that determines the aging
            trajectory. Therefore, the training objective can be rewritten as
            <p>
              $$ \min_{\theta_0} \int_\omega\int_t L(x,y,\theta_0,
              A_\omega(t)){\rm d}t{\rm d}\omega $$
            </p>
            This objective function can be numerically estimated by Monte-Carlo
            integration, and then is will be able to be optimized through
            gradient descent. Other factors can also be included into the
            training objective in similar way.

            Figure 5 exemplarifies a simple example of aging-aware training. The
            pink curve has an initial weights with higher loss, but the whole
            aging trajectory falls into a low-loss region. In contrast, the blue
            curve has a lower loss at the beginning, but the aging trajectory
            leads to a higher loss.
